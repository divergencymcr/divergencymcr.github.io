**Live Art Workshop**    
This is a practice based series of sessions focusing on developing the beginnings of a new piece of solo work, with an opportunity to work informally as a group between workshops.   
*nb. People new to Divergency are welcome to attend, but we would ask that you commit to all three sessions.*           
       
The term “Live Art” embraces a tremendous range of practices in terms of form, duration, tone and content. It leaps, it bleeds, it sits stark still for hours and days on end. It shouts, it sings, it recites poetry, it smashes guitars, it types code and shreds texts. And it attracts a fantastically diverse audience base, many of them looking for something different…       

**Workshop One** of this workshop starts with the unique perspective of the artist, drawing on the well of resources our identities, experiences and ambitions for the world. From there, we will explore some practical exercises to generate and refine ideas for performance. This should give participants a strong foundation for building a new piece of work and fresh approaches to their practice.      

**Workshop Two** will focus on refining work, taking it from the studio to the stage, the street or wherever else your performance comes to life. This session will ask the work what it needs from the space, materials and contexts at the artist’s disposal, interrogate what is missing, what elements might be unnecessary and what could be getting in the way of the work reaching its full potential. We will also discuss strategies for reaching our ideal venues and audiences, and how to make the work flexible enough to roll out across a variety of contexts. Finally, this session will consider the value of thinking strategically about feedback and documentation well in advance, for the benefit of the evolution of individual pieces of work and also towards the goal of building a long term live art practice.
