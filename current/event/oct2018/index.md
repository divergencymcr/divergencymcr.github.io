**Workshop: Approaches to Critical Writing**    
How can artists and audiences sidestep the star rating format to give meaningful critical responses to watching performance? A workshop lead by Salome Wagaine.        
                   
**About Salome Wagaine**

Founder of Spit the Pips, their first project was KINKS, CURLS AND CASH, a documentary about the British natural hair scene and its entrepreneurs. Their next project, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, is about the life and use of some of London's private cemeteries.
