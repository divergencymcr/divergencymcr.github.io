Chanje Kunda is a solo artist working nationally and internationally as both a poet and performance artist.        
         
Her last full length show *Amsterdam* fused spoken word with live art and was nominated for Best Studio Production by Manchester Theatre Awards. It toured nationally to Nottingham Playhouse, Camden People's Theatre, The Albany, Cast, Contact, and The Drum, as well as at the National Rural Touring Conference; it was also performed in South Africa at the National Arts Festival at Grahamstown and at Podium Mozaiek Theater in Amsterdam, Netherlands.         
         
Her current show has been developed through Divergency…        
         
#### *Superposition*
What are the real laws of attraction?         
         
Unlikely bed-fellows quantum mechanics, existentialism and erotic dance combine in this celebration of female sensuality from a feminist perspective.
         
"People assume that people lap-dance just because they really need the money and have no other options, through circumstance or education. So, as quite a bookish, published poet, why on earth did I decide to do a lap-dancing course? The truth is I absolutely fell in love with it as a performance style and means of self-expression. This led me to think about my body as a black woman and how I can find ways of exploring the ownership of it, and I came up with the central question of 'how is a black woman's sex like quantum mechanics and existentialism?' This is my attempt to answer it…"
