**Workshop: Afro-Futurism**    
A movement workshop looking at Afro-diasporic dance and afrofuturism. Inspired by Haitian Folklore, ritual movement, rhythm and song, the workshop explores how this can create transcendental experiences and performances. The workshop joins the inner life of the imagination and ancestry with the outer life of being present in the space.
