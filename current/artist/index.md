Divergency is an informal network, supporting a small group of culturally diverse artists to explore live art in their practice. Bringing together both new artists and those experienced in different artforms, Divergency is a year-round programme of exploring and making, watching and talking.          
             
We meet, we talk, we eat (often), we see work and we explore — through a series of workshops led by both the group and invited guest artists.                
            
So far, Divergency has seed-funded seven early stage works, shown at various stages of development in [October 2016](/archive/event/showcase2016), and following a subsequent in [March 2017](/archive/event/mixology2017), the group has widened — their development continues…          
          
Divergency was established in 2014 in response to a Creative Case North residency investigating under-representation in Live Art, and is supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England, and by hÅb + STUN (Sustained Theatre Up North).
