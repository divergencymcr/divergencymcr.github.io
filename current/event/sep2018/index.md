**Mixology**    
Challenging the barriers encountered by artists of colour exploring Live Art. A group meal + discussion, with guest Tarik Elmoutawakil.

In May 2014, we invited a diverse group of artists to come together for a meal, a glass of wine and a conversation about Live Art and cultural diversity. And so, Divergency was born…         
         
A gathering of like-minded people, over the last 2 years we have eaten (plenty), drunk (even more) and talked, sometimes even argued (too much). We've also done workshops, seen and put-on performances and sown the seeds for a new crop of work.     
          
Now we'd like to mix things up — and we'd like to invite you to join us in exploring, talking, watching, and making Live Art. There'll be food, there'll be talk, there'll be a bit of performance — and we might even be mixing our drinks…
