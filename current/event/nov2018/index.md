**Workshop: *Killing Time***    
Do you kill your creative ideas before they’re born? Do you notice that the more time you have, the less you get done? Are you constantly getting in your own way?      

Introducing *Killing Time*!     
This workshop that galvanizes participants to:      
Move faster than think    
Create faster than critique      
Resist resistance      
Pulverize procrastination.    

*Killing Time* is a physical workshop that welcomes anyone who is curious about live art and performance. One must have a willingness to try out new ideas and an adventurous spirit to walk out into the unknown.
